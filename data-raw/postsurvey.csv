10,4,"Yes, it met my expectations",Yes,4,4,4,4,4,"Yes, most of the time",3,3,3,The course material for each week is very well-structured so it's relatively easy to follow.

The structure of the verbs was easy to remember as they all had a similar structure, making it easy to transform and mutate data",None,You may consider covering functions so that people can know how to write their own functions for data analysis activities in the case where available functions fail to do the analysis,"The timing was not accommodating working times. However, it was good because all the relevant materials, like slides, assignments, reading materials, etc were available on the website",NA

I really liked this option that was offered so that we could do the coding ourselves just after the instructor had done it. And above all, I discovered something I hadn't known before: R markdown. Since then, I've been using it as a learning tool.",NA,"My suggestion would be to see if it's possible to start the courses from the 2nd quarter, because for us who work in NGOs, the end and beginning of the year are too busy (with field missions, reports to finalize, projects to close... Etc) so it's a fairly busy period that limits us in carrying out assignments and even follow the courses.",NA,NA

The timing was good, in a sense that it allowed most students involved to carry along with their respective course programs.","It was never easy to look for a data set to use, especially for the beginners.","The course content that will be covered should be the only ones displayed. I had a lot of interest in learning module 9 (Artificial intelligence) because I had seen it in the course outline, but time didn't allow for it to be taught.","It was a great time, 
1. Getting to expand my social network beyond the borders of my motherland.
2. Interacting with professionals in the disciplines that I aspire to pursue and getting to know how data science skills are relevant to it was satisfactory.
